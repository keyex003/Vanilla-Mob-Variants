# Vanilla-Mob-Variants
Taking inspiration from Optifine's random alternate mob textures, this resource pack brings 100 subtle variations for each included mob so that they don't all look like clones! This is done using a combination of alternate textures (including baby-specific textures) and entity tinting to make even mobs with the same texture look slightly unique. This pack will continue to be updated with more mobs and textures as long as people show interest in it, so vote for what should be added next!
### Why a resource pack?
Unlike addons that use a behaviour pack, resource packs can be applied in the global resources settings and then used everywhere - server, realms, and survival worlds without disabling achievements. Just set and forget!
### Current Features: 
- (V): Variant textures, 5 additional textures per mob
- (T): Subtle tinting, 100 different tints per mob
- (B): Baby-specific texture, 1 per mob
### Current Mobs:
- Pig (VTB)
